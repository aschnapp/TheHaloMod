    <h4>How To Acknowledge Use Of TheHaloMod</h4>

    Thank you very much for using TheHaloMod (or the hmf or halomod backends) for your
    research.
    We hope it has met your needs. If you have found it to be a useful tool,
    please let us know! The best way to do this is to cite
    <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6721" target="_blank">this article</a>,
    which details TheHaloMod's functionality, and also has some background on the HMF.
